## Data
Today, weâ€™ll use ggplot to visually explore patterns in morphological traits in three

different species of penguin. This data were collected and made available by 

Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, and were compiled 

by Dr. Allison Horst and colleagues.
<br>
The `palmerpenguins` data contains size measurements for three penguin species

observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Single trait distribution

Exploring the body mass of the penguins species.

what is the lowest and highest body mass do penguins in this dataset have? Do different species have different body mass? How much do they overlap?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, color=species))
```
what is the lowest and highest bill lengths do penguins in this dataset have? Do different species have different bill lengths? How much do they overlap?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm, fill=species), alpha=0.5)
```

## Relationship between multiple traits

what is the relationship between body mass and flipper length in penguins in this dataset? Does this relationship differ between species? 

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+
  theme_classic()
```

Given the same body mass, which species of penguins tend to have the longest flippers?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+
 geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species), method = 'lm')+
  theme_classic()
```

##Sexual dimophism

what traits are sexually dimorphic in the penguins dataset? Is the level of sexual dimorphism the same in all three penguin species?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, colour = sex))+
  facet_wrap(~species)+
  theme_get()
```

##Free exploration

you can look at any temporal trend in the dataset, or patterns within the same species across different islands.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=year, fill= island))+
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
