```{r, echo=TRUE}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library (palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

dim(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
head(penguins)
```

what is the relationship between body mass and flipper length in penguins in this dataset? Does this relationship differ between species? 

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+
  theme_classic()
```

Given the same body mass, which species of penguins tend to have the longest flippers?

```{r}
ggplot(penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))+
 geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species), method = 'lm')+
  theme_classic()
```
