## Data
Today, weâ€™ll use ggplot to visually explore patterns in morphological traits in three

different species of penguin. This data were collected and made available by 

Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, and were compiled 

by Dr. Allison Horst and colleagues.
<br>
The `palmerpenguins` data contains size measurements for three penguin species

observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
