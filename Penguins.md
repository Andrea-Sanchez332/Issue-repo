## Data

Today, we’ll use ggplot to visually explore patterns in morphological
traits in three

different species of penguin. This data were collected and made
available by

Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, and were
compiled

by Dr. Allison Horst and colleagues. <br> The `palmerpenguins` data
contains size measurements for three penguin species

observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
